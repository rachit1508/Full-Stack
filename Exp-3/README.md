Bootstrap Purpose: Demonstrates integrating Vite with Bootstrap to prototype responsive layouts quickly. Contents: A Vite project scaffold, index.html, and a simple component structure in src showcasing grid, navbar, and utility classes. Experiments: Tested Bootstrap CDN vs. local npm install, examined theming by overriding CSS variables, and compared performance between compiled and dev modes. Learnings: How to scope Bootstrap styles to avoid global collisions and how to combine Bootstrap with custom CSS modules. Notes: Useful as a quick UI prototype; keep vendor CSS minimal to reduce bundle size. Files of interest: App.jsx and public/index.html demonstrate Bootstrap usage.

Contents: Multiple card variations (image top, side-by-side, with footer), CSS demos in App.css, and small layout experiments. Experiments: Explored shadow/light modes, hover interactions, and image aspect handling with object-fit. Learnings: Best practices for accessible card markup, focus states, and responsive breakpoints for cards. Notes: Intended as a component reference for reuse across other projects. Files of interest: App.jsx, App.css.

ComLib Purpose: Component library experiment to centralize reusable UI pieces. Contents: Small set of components (buttons, inputs, badges) with consistent props and style tokens. Experiments: Prop-driven theming, API surface design, and packaging components for reuse across projects. Learnings: Component API ergonomics, default props vs. CSS-only variants, and lightweight documentation patterns. Notes: Not published—kept local; consider moving to a mono-repo or npm package later. Files of interest: src components folder.

FormSPA Purpose: Single-page app focused on form handling, validation, and UX patterns. Contents: Forms with controlled inputs, client-side validation, and example submission flows. Experiments: Implemented both simple validators and schema-based validation (pattern demonstration), and used debounced input checks. Learnings: UX for inline errors, preventing double submissions, and basic accessibility improvements for forms (aria attributes). Notes: Good reference for future signup/login forms; consider integrating a validation lib if complexity grows. Files of interest: App.jsx, src/components/* form pieces.

LinkNav Purpose: Explore link navigation behaviors and router link patterns. Contents: Small demos showing Link, NavLink, anchor fallback, and programmatic navigation. Experiments: Compared NavLink active styles, hash vs. pathname navigation, and external link handling. Learnings: How to maintain active state, accessibility of link text, and when to prefer programmatic navigation. Notes: Useful reference for routing style guidelines in other SPAs. Files of interest: main.jsx, App.jsx (navigation examples).

MultiSPARouting Purpose: Demonstrates multiple SPA routing techniques and nested route patterns. Contents: A Vite app with multiple routes (/, /dashboard) and simple page components. Experiments: Implemented nested routes, Link navigation, and asset imports (images/SVG). Also tested route-based code-splitting ideas. Learnings: How BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route compose; pitfalls with JSX syntax (fixed an img duplication in App.jsx). Notes: The routing demo is minimal and intended for teaching route structure; can be expanded with lazy loading. Files of interest: App.jsx (fixed JSX), assets for images.

RoutingSPA Purpose: A deeper SPA routing example covering dynamic routes, params, and protected routes patterns. Contents: Multiple pages, sample protected route logic, and route guards for basic auth flows. Experiments: Simulated auth context to gate routes, used route params for detail pages, and tested 404 handling. Learnings: Patterns for route protection, location-based redirects, and structuring route config for scalability. Notes: Good starting point for apps requiring auth + nested routing; integrate real auth provider later. Files of interest: pages, App.jsx routing config.

Simple Purpose: Minimal starter app to test Vite, JSX, and basic asset loading without extra dependencies. Contents: Barebones index.html, main.jsx, and a single App.jsx with trivial markup. Experiments: Fast feedback loop for testing framework upgrades and small CSS experiments. Learnings: Useful for isolating issues—if a bug appears here, it's likely infra-related. Notes: Keep it tiny; use for reproducing minimal test cases. Files of interest: main.jsx, App.jsx.

SPA Purpose: Larger SPA example combining routing, assets, and multiple pages into a demo application. Contents: Pages, shared components, assets, and a slightly richer layout than the minimal examples. Experiments: Tested layout composition, global state patterns, and asset optimizations in Vite build. Learnings: How to structure a mid-size SPA; tradeoffs between centralized state vs. local state per page. Notes: Serves as an integration playground; consider adding tests and CI for stability. Files of interest: pages, components, vite.config.js.

UIDesign Purpose: Visual and UI experimentation—color systems, spacing, and component visuals. Contents: Style explorations, mockups, and working prototypes of UI components with CSS focus. Experiments: Design tokens, CSS variables, and different layout systems (flex vs. grid). Learnings: How small token systems make theme changes easier; recommended CSS organization strategies. Notes: Treat as a design system seed for future component libraries. Files of interest: src styles and pattern files.
